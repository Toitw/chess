Project: To build a functional console PvP chess game

Initial idea is to create 5 classes: Board, Piece, Game, Player and Visual

Board will be a nested array with each array being a square of the board. Pieces will be each of the types of pieces, then 2 players, the game mechanics and a class for the visuals.

The key will be to manage the movements of each type of piece. Also, I find the most difficult part to create a system for the checks, and something for possible draws, apart form special movements like en passant or castling
